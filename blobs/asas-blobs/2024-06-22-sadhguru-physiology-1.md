Let's talk today about the lumbar region of the spine.

- It is the lowest region that connects up to the tailbone
- there is a slight inward "lordotic curve", essentially pitching you forward at the waist
- Isha Yoga Namaskar heavily involves the muscles in this region.
  I would love to hear Sadhguru talk on Huberman's show, with Huberman just serving him tons of examples where the research turned out to totally support the seemingly "magic yoga claims".

The blood vessels which go upward are a finer arrangement compared to those going down. As they go up into the brain, they are almost hair-like, to such a point that they cannot even take one extra drop. If one extra drop is pumped in, something will burst and you will have a hemorrhage.

Your level of intelligence after the age of 35 drops in many ways unless you take enormous care to keep it up. You are managing because of your memory, not because of your intelligence.
