              <p>
                Let's talk today about the lumbar region of the spine. * It is
                the lowest region that connects up to the tailbone * there is a
                slight inward "lordotic curve", essentially pitching you forward
                at the waist * Isha Yoga Namaskar heavily involves the muscles
                in this region. I would love to hear Sadhguru talk on Huberman's
                show, with Huberman just serving him tons of examples where the
                research turned out to totally support the seemingly "magic yoga
                claims". > [!quote]- > **Sadhguru:** In India, you were told
                that you should not place your head to the north while sleeping.
                Why? > > Your heart is not located half-way down, it is placed
                three-fourths of the way up because pumping blood up against
                gravity is more difficult than pumping it down. The blood
                vessels which go upward are a finer arrangement compared to
                those going down. As they go up into the brain, they are almost
                hair-like, to such a point that they cannot even take one extra
                drop. If one extra drop is pumped in, something will burst and
                you will have a hemorrhage.   > > Most people have hemorrhages
                in their brain. This does not incapacitate you in any major way,
                but small damages happen. You may become duller, which people
                are becoming. Your level of intelligence after the age of 35
                drops in many ways unless you take enormous care to keep it up.
                You are managing because of your memory, not because of your
                intelligence.

                dark ages are right after the roman empire fell so many thieves
                and robbers on the roads that the romans had patrolled and kept
                safe. the communities became isolated in that period, you still
                had cities and such, people were still counted as intelligent,
                the knowledge was lost because of communication. renaissance is
                when the communicaiton is opening up, the books are opening up
                knowledge was trapped in teh abbeys, where the monks were
                maintaining the knowledge over the years. thats why there are so
                many questions about what happened at the library of alexandria,
                the knowledge that was lost there. During the dark ages, there
                were the crusades. Europe V.S. the islamic powers in the East.
                Dissemination of information between the christian scholars and
                muslim scolars, between 10th and 12th century, they closed the
                concept of ishtehad, which was reasoning discussion in Islam.
                Naturally, thats when things ultimately began to deteriorate for
                them, and gave victory and rise to the renaissance in Europe.
