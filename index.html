       <h1>inter activity</h1>
        <p>This website aims to optimize interactivity with responsiveness, using efficient fog keyframes to play
          with the position of the mouse and obscure elements on screen. By changing the size of elements on hover, the
          fog can be pushed down while revealing additional content. The theme is the development process as a mountain,
          and the mind as a universe. The highlighted development process exists as one planet in that universe, which
          can be explored further by scrolling down through the fog, or abandoned by choosing to explore the stars
          beyond.</p>

              <p>
                Our methodology revolves around planning large projects by dividing them into
                immediate and future tasks, connected by dependencies. Current tasks are
                organized along thematic axes, creating two towers of projects: creative and
                technical. The production process alternates between these towers to prevent
                burnout and maintain momentum, with teams working in logical succession.
