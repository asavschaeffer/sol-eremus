### Dark Ages

dark ages are right after the roman empire fell
so many thieves and robbers on the roads that the romans had patrolled and kept safe.
the communities became isolated in that period, you still had cities and such, people were still counted as intelligent, the knowledge was lost because of communication.

renaissance is when the communicaiton is opening up, the books are opening up

knowledge was trapped in the abbeys, where the monks were maintaining the knowledge over the years.

thats why there are so many questions about what happened at the library of alexandria, the knowledge that was lost there.

During the dark ages, there were the crusades. Europe V.S. the islamic powers in the East. Dissemination of information between the christian scholars and muslim scolars, between 10th and 12th century, they closed the concept of ishtehad, which was reasoning discussion in Islam. Naturally, thats when things ultimately began to deteriorate for them, and gave victory and rise to the renaissance in Europe.
