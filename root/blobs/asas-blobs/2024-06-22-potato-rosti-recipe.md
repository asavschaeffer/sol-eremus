#### process

- potato, washed and shredded, water squeezed out. salt, thyme and red pepper flakes, mixing in and removing moisture (?add butter, corn starch, flour?)
- add a bunch of butter to a hot pan, dump potato mix in, a couple minutes, seeing brown on the edges, time to flip.
- use another plate, lift it up and around, with the feeling of gravity as the potato rises and falls. Butter the plan again, pour it back in, and toss it in the oven so they cook all the way through to the center. Total cook time ?~10 minutes?
